# Donut Depot

Donut Depot is a web application that celebrates the deliciousness of the donut by providing a platform that allows donut lovers to share their experiences visiting shops and, of course, eating donuts. The primary goal of the app is to help people learn about new kinds of donuts and shops they never knew about before so they can enjoy their favorite treat in a brand new way.

Users create posts of donuts they've tried and shops they've visited to spread the word about what they've experienced. All a donut post requires is some basic information about the donut, a review of that donut, and a photo. Once a donut is posted, other users can comment on that post and interact. Users can make posts about shops as well, while other users can write reviews about that shopw once it's been posted.

Users also have a unique profile page that supports the "My Donut Box" feature, which only displays each of the donuts that particular user has posted. That way, users can keep track of all the donuts they've ever tried, whether they be just around the block or somewhere overseas. Donut Depot wants to get people just as excited about talking about donuts as they are eating them!
